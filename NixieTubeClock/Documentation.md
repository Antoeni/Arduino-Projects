Here is the documentation of how the project was created.

This project was heavily based on a youtuber's nixie tube clock.

First steps I started with creating a PCB which was essentially GreatScott's PCB but then retrofitted so that it fits with the parts that I have at hand.

After Completing the Schematic I then started with designing the PCB and placing them in the correct spots.
